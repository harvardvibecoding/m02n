Continuing on from the prior unit, this project contains the resulting output of the instructor's AI when prompted for the equity percentage test in `people_headcount_app.py`.  The learner can start from this point for test-drive reimplementation.

To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run people_headcount_app.py
```
